    <title>AirBnB Data Set</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            This is a reference page to quickly find the data set we'll be using for the labs this semester. As you work through the different labs, you should be saving your jamovi file to reflect the changes we'll make to this data set as we work through it, but you can always download the original data here. Similarly, you can find the data dictionary to get a basic review of what the data set is and what the variables measure.
