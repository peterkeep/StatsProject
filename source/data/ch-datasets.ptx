  <title>Data Sets</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        We start with the data documentation. This will serve as a helpful reference as you work with different data sets, but also as a way of deciding which data set you would like to use for your project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each section will include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A link to download the data set in multiple formats.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A brief description of what the data set is about and where it came from.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A data dictionary, with details about each variable (or column) in the data set.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
